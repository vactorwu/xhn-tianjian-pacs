COMCTL32.OCX Update Version 5.00.3828
=====================================
A new version of COMCTL32.OCX is now available for Microsoft development
products.  Version 5.00.3828 fixes a couple of problems with the 5.00.3714
and 5.00.3422 versions.

To install the new version of COMCTL32.OCX download COMCTLZP.EXE.  This is
a self-extracting zip file that when executed will extract out two files. 
The first file is README.TXT which contains these instructions.  The
second file is COMCTL32.EXE.  This file is a setup program that will
install COMCTL32.OCX and supporting files.

Before executing COMCTL32.EXE you must have the following versions of the
Automation system files on your system:

   Filename       Version   
   ------------   --------------------
   OLEAUT32.DLL   2.20.4054 or greater
     COMCAT.DLL   4.71      or greater
   OLEPRO32.DLL   5.00.4055 or greater
   ASYCFILT.DLL   2.20.4056 or greater
    STDOLE2.TLB   2.20.4054 or greater

If you do not have these files you must first download and install them as
documented in the following knowledge base article:

   Q164529: Updated Automation System Files

If you have Office 97, Visual Basic 5.0, Visual Studio 97, Internet
Explorer 3.0, or Visual C++ 5.0 you should already have these Automation
system files.

Once you are sure you have the correct Automation system files on you
system you can install COMCTL32.OCX by executing COMCTL32.EXE.  This will
install the following files:

   Filename       Version     Description
   ------------   ---------   ------------------------------------
   COMCTL32.OCX   5.00.3828   Updated ActiveX control
   COMCTL32.DEP   5.00.3828   Dependency info for VB5 Setup Wizard
   MSSTKPRP.DLL   5.00.3714   Stock Property Pages

The setup program does not install a license to use COMCTL32.OCX for
development.  You must already have a license installed on your system by
one of the products listed below:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning, Professional, and Enterprise Editions
   for Windows, version 5.0
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 97
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
 - Microsoft Office Developer Edition 97
