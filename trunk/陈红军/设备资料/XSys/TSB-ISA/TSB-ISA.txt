X-Systems CD-ROM 3-47736-01 published Dec 98

Subject: TSB and ISA files

All TSB and ISA files were updated as of 12 Oct 98 as follows:

All X-Systems and AxSYM TSB and ISA files were printed to Adobe Acrobat Writer from the Lotus Notes database.

However, since the previously published AxSYM Service Manual has numerous hyperlinks to TSBs and ISAs, the TSB-58.pdf and ISA-111.pdf files were added to this CD-ROM to eliminate the need to relink all TSB/ISA references within the manual.  That is why you will find these four files for AxSYM
- TSB-58.pdf and ISA-11.pdf are referenced from the Service Manual.
- AxSYM_ISAs.pdf and AxSYM_TSBs.pdf are linked to the CD-TOC screen and was updated with all the latest changes as of 12 Oct.
